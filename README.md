## Game genre

Trinity is a real time strategy card game, the reason why this is not a traditional turn based card game is that the player needs to promptly think which cards to pick and destroy and make the best attack possible.

## Features

Trinity has a unique feature which is a limb system. Player and Enemy have 6 body parts and the player has to pick a target card to pick a body part to attack.

## How to play the game

To defeat the enemies, using proper combinations of cards and prompt decision making are required. In battle, pick 3 cards to attack and weaken one of the enemy's body parts to win the battle, but the same can be inflicted on you. Try to use as many shielding and healing cards when you’re in a pinch.
