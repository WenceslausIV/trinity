Game title - Trinity


Game story - A brave footsoldier Dohn Jo is tasked to save the civilians of the kingdom. Dohn Jo has a super power that makes him attack with cards. He needs 3 types of cards to perform an attack. So this power is called Trinity.


Game genre - Trinity is a real time strategy card game, the reason why this is not a traditional turn based card game is that we wanted the player to promptly think which cards to pick and destroy and make the best attack possible.


Features - Trinity has a unique feature which is a limb system. Player and Enemy have 6 body parts and the player has to pick a target card to pick a body part to attack.


How to play the game - 
Player can move with the WASD keys in the open world. Defeat the enemies and take civilians to the main hub(with a civilian following, touch the green zone to direct them to safety). To defeat the enemies, using proper combinations of cards and prompt decision making are required. In battle, pick 3 cards to attack and weaken one of the enemy's body parts to win the battle, but the same can be inflicted on you. Try to use as many shielding and healing cards when you’re in a pinch.
